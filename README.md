# Automated Trades

Traditional trading methods can be time-intensive, struggle to adapt to rapidly shifting market conditions, and often result in inefficiencies. 

 ðŸ¥œ **Cashew Capital Fund** is a startup investment management fund interested in using ML to address this gap.

**Our Objective:** Design a machine learning algorithm that identifies trading opportunities through technical analysis and autonomously determine the best times to enter and exit for any particular stock.

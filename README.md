# Automated Trades

Traditional trading methods can be time-intensive, struggle to adapt to rapidly shifting market conditions, and often result in inefficiencies. 

 ðŸ¥œ **Cashew Capital Fund** is a startup investment management fund interested in using ML to address this gap.

**Our Objective:** Design a machine learning algorithm that identifies trading opportunities through technical analysis and autonomously determine the best times to enter and exit for any particular stock.

## Methodology

### Data Preparation
Data Source: Benzinga Time-Series Data
- Historical (5-min candles): [Benzinga GET Bars](https://docs.benzinga.com/benzinga-apis/bars/get-bars)
- Real-Time (15-min delay): [Benzinga Delayed API](https://docs.benzinga.com/benzinga-apis/delayed-quote/get-quoteDelayed)

| Technical Indictator | Formula | Parameters | Explanation |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | 
| Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) | (https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=e^{i%20%5Cpi}%20%3D%20-1&mode=inline) | 36-period <br> 78-period <br> (3 and 6.5 hours)| Stabilizes trends for 2-day predictions <br> Better than standard spans of 12 & 26 days|
| Relative Strength Index (RSI) | | 9-period <br> (45 min) | Optimized for voilatile markets | 
| Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) | | 27-period (Signal Line)  | Focuses on sustained signals, aligning with longer EMAs |
| Stochastic Oscillator | | 9-period (SlowK) <br> 3-period (SlowD) | (SlowK) Increases sensitivity to recent price action <br> (SlowD) Balances responsiveness with noise reduction |
